#Simple single button media controller for Teensy

Controls media similar to Apple remote on MiFi headphones. Single tap to play/pause, double tap for next track, triple tap for previous track and hold for stop.
Tested on Teensy-LC, probably works on other Teensy chips too. Connect button to pin 0.
